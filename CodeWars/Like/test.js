// You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts,
//  pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

// Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. 
// It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

// likes [] -- must be "no one likes this"
// likes ["Peter"] -- must be "Peter likes this"
// likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] -- must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
// likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] -- must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
// likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] -- must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
